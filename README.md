# vimrc
### Installation

1. Move all .files (excluding .gitignore) into you home directory
  - `mv .vimrc ~/`
  - `mv .gvimrc ~/`
  - `mv .vim ~/.vim`
1. Install [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) `git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`
1. Open vim
1. run `:PluginInstall`
1. install (MacVim)[https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim] for a GUI interface `brew install macvim`
  - You can open Mac Vim with `mvim` from the command line

That should be it. Some plugins might have extra steps to getting them installed.

I will update this with additional installation instructions, and comments on customizations to Vim and it's config.
