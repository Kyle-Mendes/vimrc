# vimrc
### Installation

1. Install [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) `git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`
1. Open vim
1. run `:PluginInstall`

That should be it. Some plugins might have extra steps to getting them installed.

I will update this with additional installation instructions, and comments on customizations to Vim and it's config.
